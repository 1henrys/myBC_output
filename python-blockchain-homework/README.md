# Python Blockchain Wallet Homework

### Functionality

Despite multiple attempts both in python script directly and thru separate debug cells in jupyter notebook, couldnt get the derive function to work. Never got to the point of creating a dictionary of lists of dictionaries. The class activities worked for me tho...

### Installing
Within a gitbash terminal (opened as admin on win10), cd into the `wallet` folder and run the following:

    ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive
      cd hd-wallet-derive
      curl https://getcomposer.org/installer -o installer.php
      php installer.php
      php composer.phar install
    ```
