## The PupperCoin token

The startup company is using a crowd sale for their PupperCoin to fund further development of their global dog breeding activity network, which can track individual pet genetic trail.

The crowdsale is legally limited to 300 ETH for maximum of 24 weeks.

### Contract solidity code

An ERC20 token is minted through a `Crowdsale` contract leveraged from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library. The `rate` was hardcoded to maintain parity with ETH.
* [`PupperCoin.sol`](PupperCoin.sol)
* [`Crowdsale.sol`](Crowdsale.sol)
